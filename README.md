## Shaders
[<b>Shader graph: Rigid body animation using vertex animation textures</b>](https://storyprogramming.com/2019/09/18/shader-graph-rigid-body-animation-using-vertex-animation-textures/) – generator that can record animation, create a combined mesh, and generate vertex animation textures. Vertex animation textures are then used by special shader to play the recorded animation on a single mesh transforming all parts of the mesh on GPU.

[<b>Shade graph: Force shield with hits</b>](https://storyprogramming.com/2019/09/17/shader-graph-force-shield-with-hits/) – force shield effect that uses Custom function Node to display hits and support dissolving.

[<b>Shader graph: Scan effect</b>](https://storyprogramming.com/2019/09/17/shader-graph-scan-effect/) – effect that uses depth intersection to draw mesh parts only where mesh collides with the scene geometry.

[<b>Shader graph: Dissolve effect</b>](https://storyprogramming.com/2019/09/17/shader-graph-dissolve-effect/) – effect of appearing/disappearing.

## Mesh manipulation
[<b>Double-sided mesh generator</b>](https://storyprogramming.com/2019/04/23/double-sided-mesh-generator/) – generator that can generate a double-sided mesh from any given mesh. Double-sided meshes can be useful for some effects like force shields
